\title{Generate a reparameterized P-spline base}
\usage{
sm(x, K = min(length(unique(x)), 20), spline.degree = 3,
  diff.ord = 2, rankZ = 0.999, centerBase = T, centerx = x,
  decomposition = c("ortho", "MM", "asIs"), tol = 1e-10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{covariate}

\item{K}{number of basis functions in the original basis (defaults to 20)}

\item{spline.degree}{defaults to 3 for cubic B-plines}

\item{diff.ord}{order of the difference penalty, defaults to 2 for penalizing
deviations from linearity}

\item{rankZ}{how many eigenvectors to retain from the eigen decomposition:
either a number > 3 or the proportion of the sum of eigenvalues the
retained eigenvectors must represent at least. Defaults to .999.}

\item{centerBase}{project the basis of the penalized part into the complement
of the column space of the basis of the unpenalized part? defaults to TRUE}

\item{centerx}{vector of x-values used for centering (defaults to \code{x})}

\item{decomposition}{use a truncated spectral decomposition of the implied
prior covariance of \eqn{f(x)} for a low rank representation with
orthogonal basis functions and i.i.d. coefficients (\code{"ortho"}), or use
the mixed model reparameterization for non-orthogonal basis functions and
i.i.d. coefficients (\code{"MM"}) or use basis functions as they are with
i.i.d. coefficients (\code{"asIs"}). Defaults to \code{"ortho"}.}

\item{tol}{count eigenvalues smaller than this as zero}
}
\value{
a basis for a smooth function in x
}
\description{
The returned matrix is a low-rank approximation of the original P-spline
basis (unless \code{decomposition = "asIs"}), that is projected into the
complement of the nullspace of the associated penalty (unless
\code{centerBase = FALSE}), i.e. for the default second order difference
penalty, the resulting basis cannot reproduce linear or constant functions
and parameterizes the "wiggly" part of the influence of \code{x} only. This
means that it very rarely makes sense to run a model with \code{sm(x)}
without also using \code{\link{lin}(x)} or \code{\link{u}(x)}. The projection
improves the separability between the linear and smooth parts of the
influence of \code{x} and centers the resulting function estimates s.t
\eqn{\sum_i f(x_i) = 0}.
