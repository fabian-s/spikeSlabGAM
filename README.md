An R-package for Bayesian variable selection, model choice, and regularized estimation for (spatial) generalized additive mixed regression models via stochastic search variable selection with spike-and-slab priors.

- Fits **additive models** for **Gaussian, Binary/Binomial and Poisson responses** 
- (Correlated) **random effects** 
- Automagically performs **variable selection** and **function selection** (i.e., do I need this model term at all, is it linear or is it non-linear?), also for interactions between multiple covariates. 
- Yields **marginal posterior inclusion probabilities** for each term as well as **posterior model probabilities** and model-averaged effect estimates.
- Convenient **formula-based model specification**
- Fully Bayesian via MCMC, multiple parallelized chains for diagnostics and faster mixing, sampler implemented in `C`.
